The present work proposes a non-visual component developed in Object Pascal programming languages, for Genetic Algorithms called "TGAlgorithm". Developed in a fully object-oriented framework, the Component exploits this feature to facilitate its extension to genetic algorithms and specific problems, be they single-purpose. In this work an example of the use of "TGAlgorithm" for an implementation of a genetic algorithm mono-objective is presented.
